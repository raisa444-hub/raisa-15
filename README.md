description This project develops, trains and evaluates deep learning models (LSTM or TCN) for multivariate time series forecasting and compares them to a classical statistical baseline (e.g., SARIMAX). It includes a robust preprocessing pipeline (scaling, missing-value imputation, feature engineering), unit tests for the pipeline.
